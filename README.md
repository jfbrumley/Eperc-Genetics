*Etheostoma percnurum* was first described as a member of the Fantail species group within the darter subgenus *Catonotus*.<sup>1</sup> The subgenus *Catonotus* is characterized by a unique reproductive strategy (males create cavities in for nesting, the females lay eggs on the upper surface of the cavity, and the males fertilize and guard the eggs).<sup>2</sup> With the discovery of the paraphyly of *Catonotus*, *E. percnurum* is now considered a member of the clade *Richiella* within the larger clade *Goneaperca*.<sup>3</sup> Clade *Richiella* is synonymous with the Fantail species group within *Catonotus*, consisting of *E. kennicotti*, *E. flabellare*, *E. humerale*, *E. brevispinum*, and the *E. percnurum* species complex.

In 2008, the *Etheostoma percnurum* species complex was described as 4 distinct species by Rebecca E. Blanton and Robert E. Jenkins.<sup>4</sup> The 4 species within the complex are:

> *Etheostoma percnurum* (Jenkins 1994) found in the Clinch River system of the Tennessee River drainage.

> *Etheostoma marmorpinnum* (Blanton & Jenkins 2008) found in the Little River system of the Tennessee River drainage.

> *Etheostoma sitikuense* (Blanton 2008) found in the Little Tennessee River system of the Tennessee River drainage.

> *Etheostoma lemniscatum* (Blanton 2008) found in the Big South Fork system of the Cumberland River drainage.

These 4 species were described as genetically and meristically distinct and were elevated to specis status. However, all species within the complex are federally listed as endangered under the species name *Etheostoma percnurum* by USFWS and the ESA of 1973. 

This work is funded by USFWS to look at the genetic diversity of 3 of the species within the complex: *E. percnurum, E. marmorpinnum,* and *E. lemniscatum.*
