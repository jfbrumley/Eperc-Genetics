# *Etheostoma percnurum* Species Complex
Repository for the Genetic Analyses of 3 Species within the *Etheostoma percnurum* Species Complex.

In 2008, the *Etheostoma percnurum* species complex was described as 4 distinct species by Rebecca E. Blanton and Robert E. Jenkins.<sup>1</sup> The 4 species within the complex are:

> *Etheostoma percnurum* (Jenkins 1994) found in the Clinch River system of the Tennessee River drainage.

> *Etheostoma marmorpinnum* (Blanton & Jenkins 2008) found in the Little River system of the Tennessee River drainage.

> *Etheostoma sitikuense* (Blanton 2008) found in the Little Tennessee River system of the Tennessee River drainage.

> *Etheostoma lemniscatum* (Blanton 2008) found in the Big South Fork system of the Cumberland River drainage.

These 4 species were described as genetically and meristically distinct and were elevated to specis status. However, all species within the complex are federally listed as endangered under the species name *Etheostoma percnurum* by USFWS and the ESA of 1973. 

This work is funded by USFWS to look at the genetic diversity of 3 of the species within the complex: *E. percnurum, E. marmorpinnum,* and *E. lemniscatum.*
